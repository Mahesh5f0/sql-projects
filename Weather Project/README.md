# üå¶Ô∏è Weather Database Project  

This project is a **Weather Dataset Analysis** using SQL queries. The dataset contains different weather parameters like temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, atmospheric pressure, and weather conditions.  
The main objective is to practice SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.  


## üìÇ Dataset Details  
The dataset contains **8 columns**:  - [Weather Database Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JKDv4C1_jXYmbqki2z9yVlYMV3pRaDgD/view?usp=drive_link)  

| Column Name            | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| Date/Time              | Timestamp of weather record (MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM) |
| Temp_C                 | Temperature in ¬∞C |
| Dew Point Temp_C       | Dew point temperature in ¬∞C |
| Rel Humidity           | Moisture in the air (%) |
| Wind Speed (km/h)      | Wind speed in km/h |
| Visibility (km)        | Visibility in kilometers |
| Pressure (kPa)         | Atmospheric pressure in kilopascals |
| Weather                | Weather condition |


## üìù Weather Data SQL Queries & Analysis  

A collection of useful SQL queries for analyzing weather data. Each query follows the format: **SQL statement** plus the **Result**.

### 1. Maximum Temperature Recorded - [Result](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H7KwyWAs9kVMPA2II4y2V-XBYjanpAVU/view?usp=drive_link)  
```sql
SELECT MAX(Temp_C) AS max_temperature FROM weather;
```
  
### 2. Distinct Weather Conditions - [Result](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wc4AzDBKwVa8qt967_S8N2526PQrwfJ9/view?usp=drive_link%20)

SELECT COUNT(*) AS foggy_hours FROM weather
WHERE weather LIKE '%fog%';
```

### 4. Average Temperature by Weather Condition - [Result](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vfzBNULIqjf60iqPlZv9X5wPcIkvZdNi/view?usp=drive_link)  
```sql
SELECT weather, AVG(temp_c) AS avg_temperature FROM weather
GROUP BY weather
ORDER BY avg_temperature DESC;
```

### 5. Hours with Visibility Below 1km - [Result](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1feRHKv1Eo_Um4yam_OIwtcx_MJHRME09/view?usp=drive_link)  
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS low_visibility_hours FROM weather
WHERE visibility_km < 1;
```

### 6. Average Pressure When Temperature Below 0¬∞C - [Result](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kKpw3yciPzWRx0t6BfcZADMXn80w3p2k/view?usp=drive_link)  
```sql
SELECT AVG(press_kpa) AS avg_pressure FROM weather
WHERE temp_c < 0;
```

### 7. Rainy Hours - [Result](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z_ZHRUGn8evkmL5ztmSXX0TADRgs2wAm/view?usp=drive_link)
